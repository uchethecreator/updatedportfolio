# updatedportfolio
This is a simple portfolio website built from scratch with just HTML and CSS, *no javascript yet*
the website consists of an introductory part, about me section, "my sercices" setion, skills section,  and finally a social media contact secton.
the website is still static for now, I will add some javascript later as i learn more on frontend web dev. I will keep on improving the website till it is perfect.
It is not yet responsive on all devices yet, but it is perfec on desktop and laptop devices, as I said, it is still under improvement.
